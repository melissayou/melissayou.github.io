          Lost & Found is an Android app for reporting lost and found items on Duke Campus. If you lost your personal items at a specific location, you can simply post a LOST request at the location. Or if you find any lost item, you can take a picture of the item and post it to our app to look for the owner. Our app also supports in-mail messaging which allows users to communicate with one another easily.

      <h3>ALPHA</h3>
      We have a basic but working main page that allows a user to submit an item with a title, description, and contact info that is then saved in firebase.
      We have completed the authentication using Firebase Authentication API and also partially finished GPS features.<br/>We are currently working on the camera, messaging, GPS features and complete remaining activities.
      <div>
      <h3>BETA</h3>
      Submission of Lost items are uploaded to firebase allowing a user to submit an item with a title, description, contact info, location, date, and image from gallery or camera.
      The google map api has been implemented for choosing the location to upload and a map view of items that have been found.
      A search feature is now implemented, so you can filter the items.
      Profile Pictures are able to be selected from the profile menu button and stored on firebase to override the default picture.<br/>
      Next up will be bug fixing and messaging implementation with possible other features to be rolled out as well.
