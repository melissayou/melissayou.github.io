          Lost & Found is an Android app for reporting lost and found items on Duke Campus. If you lost your personal items at a specific location, you can simply post a LOST request at the location. Or if you find any lost item, you can take a picture of the item and post it to our app to look for the owner. Our app also supports in-mail messaging which allows users to communicate with one another easily.
